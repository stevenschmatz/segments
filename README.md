# Segments

Segments is a simple watchface that counts the day down in 6 minute blocks.

There are 240 of these blocks in a day – an easily number to comprehend. Better than 86,400 seconds in a day, and more specific than 24 hours.

By better being able to mentally grasp how much time your actions take, you'll understand time better and be able to spend your time more effectively.
